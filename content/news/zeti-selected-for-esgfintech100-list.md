**The world’s most innovative businesses offering tech solutions to address challenges or opportunities faced by financial institutions in the areas of climate risk, sustainability, social responsibility and governance were named today on the ESGFinTech100 list.**

The pressure on financial institutions to adopt sustainability goals has increased rapidly over the last year driven by rising demand for ESG products by consumers and the introduction of new regulations and reporting standards aimed to stamp out greenwashing in corporate disclosures.

As a result, the number of tech companies addressing challenges or opportunities faced by financial services organisations in the areas of climate risk, ESG assessment, sustainability, social responsibility and governance has exploded over the last year. Investment in the sector hit $1.17bn in 2021 growing at a CAGR of 173% over the last two years.

Given the huge rise in appetite for ESG tech solutions in financial services, the ESGFinTech100 was produced to identify the 100 most innovative tech companies every financial institution needs to know about as they consider and develop their ESG assessment and performance improvement strategies.

The standout companies were chosen by a panel of industry experts and analysts who reviewed a study of over 500 ESG tech companies undertaken by FinTech Global, a data and research firm. The solution providers making the final list were recognised for their innovative use of technology to solve a significant industry problem, or their impact on ESG imperatives and/or sustainability enhancements generated for clients.

FinTech Global director Richard Sachar said, *“Banks that adopt ESG across their business model will be better positioned to engage and retain clients over the coming years. This can turn into a competitive advantage – and a source of new revenue streams.”*

*"The ESGFinTech100 list helps senior management filter through all the solution providers in the market by highlighting the most innovative ESG tech companies in areas such as ESG Assessment & Reporting, Regulatory Change Management, ESG Intelligence & Data Analysis, Supply Chain Screening and Banking & Investment products”* he added.

A full list of the ESGFinTech100 can be found at [www.ESGFinTech100.com](http://www.esgfintech100.com/). More detailed information about the companies is available to download for free on the website.

We're excited to offer our unique ESG asset class of pay-per-mile electric vehicles to financial institutions in the U.K, U.S.A, and across the world"*, said Daniel Bass, CTO and Co-Founder of Zeti.
