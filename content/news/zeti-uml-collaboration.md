We are pleased to announce Zeti as the FinTech partner to Los Angeles’ [Urban Movement Labs](https://www.urbanmovementlabs.com/) to support the goal of accelerating the adoption of clean, connected and accessible vehicles within the City. 

Zeti is excited to be the FinTech partner to Urban Movement Labs and help accelerate the adoption of sustainable transport in LA. By working with UML’s partners, Zeti’s digital platform will mobilize institutional capital at scale to finance zero-emission vehicles while improving cash flow and cost transparency to the vehicles’ operators via pay-as-you-drive billing.

Urban Movement Labs, with the support of Mayor Eric Garcetti and its founding partners, is a terrific example of how an alliance can be forged between the public sector, tech and transportation companies to solve transportation challenges within cities.

We’re looking forward to working with UML’s founding partners: [MoceanLab](https://www.moceanlab.com/), [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/), [Waymo](https://waymo.com/), [Avis Budget Group](https://avisbudgetgroup.com/), [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/), [City of Los Angeles](https://www.linkedin.com/company/city-of-los-angeles/) and [Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/laincubator/).
