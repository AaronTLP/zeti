**Glasgow – 14th November 2023:** HVS (Hydrogen Vehicle Systems), an innovator in zero-emission commercial vehicles, are delighted to announce a partnership with Zeti which will involve collaboration with Gravis Capital to provide a Transport as a Service offering to customers of HVS Hydrogen Fuel Cell Trucks.
