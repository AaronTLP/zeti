    plugin called Advanced Custom Fields and a Flexible Content field that

We’ve now formally launched our US office! After winning [CoMotion LA](https://comotionla.com/la-new-mobility-challenge-2020) and seeing continued demand from fleet operators and manufacturers, we were inspired to set up Zeti Inc., appointing the experienced and expert team of Pete Malcolm as President, and Rebecca Saletta as our Head of Strategic Partnerships.\
\
Dan and Rebecca recently attended [ACT Expo](https://www.actexpo.com/), the LA-based clean transport conference, to meet up with a whole host of vehicle manufacturers, fleets and solution providers. These kinds of partnerships will form the basis of our first projects out in the US this summer!
