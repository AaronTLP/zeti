Zeti is proud to announce that it has been selected as one of only nine companies to represent UK innovation in offering solutions for a zero emission Future of Transport. The Department of International Trade will be hosting the trade delegation to Los Angeles in November 2021, with Zeti being the only FinTech in the cohort.

The other companies included in the cohort are AMTE Power, Eatron, ENSO, Immense, Kaluza, Riversimple Movement, TEVVA and Viritech.

Zeti’s patent-pending financial technology enables progressive companies to adopt EV's by making it as simple, transparent and flexible as paying for any other utility.
