LONDON, UK and SANTA MONICA, Calif., March 8, 2023 –  Zeti, a leading provider of financial services technology to manage consumption-based EV and infrastructure financing, today announced its pay-per-mile ZERO platform is powering the deployment of a further 150 electric taxis in London.

Colts Cabs, one of London’s most prevalent taxi companies, is continuing to transition its fleet to zero-emission transport using Zeti’s pay-per-mile technology for the 4th time, adding to the 135 electric vehicles that Zeti has already enabled for Colts’ wider fleet.

Colts’ latest fleet of electric taxis has been financed by investment fund [Gravis](https://www.graviscapital.com/) who worked with Zeti on a previous transaction of 100 black cabs.     

Zeti acts as a marketplace for institutional financiers to deploy capital into clean, connected vehicle fleets through a pay-per-mile (or km or kWh) model; managing automated payments and real-time financial and sustainability reporting for financiers and fleet operators via its digital platform, ZERO.          

> “We are excited to grow our partnerships with both Gravis and Colts and continue to help businesses move to a more sustainable future. We’re proud to have now helped finance over 500 EVs in London.”
>
> \- Emma Bell, *Investment Director, Zeti*
