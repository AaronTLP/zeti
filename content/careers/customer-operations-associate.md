**A﻿bout Zeti**

Zeti is a mobility fintech scale-up helping fight the climate battle. How? We’ve created a pay-as-you-drive (pay-per-mile) financing solution for fleets of zero emission vehicles. Zeti is rethinking automotive financing by bringing a new level of transparency, flexibility, and collaboration to the transportation industry amidst its rapid transition to cleaner vehicle alternatives.

We’re headquartered in London and are now building out our first US team in California (not just because of the sun, we promise!). We’re a fun bunch who value creativity, honesty, intelligence, hard work, resilience, and communication. Sound like you? Come join us as we grow!

**About the role**

Our Santa Monica office has a new role available to grow and manage the development and operations of our US customers and projects. You will be responsible for ensuring the delivery of strong and proactive service across many areas and will be the operational lead on our first US deployments. You will be working directly with out US Director of Strategic Partnerships, while also communicating regularly with our UK-based Operations and Tech teams.

**What you’ll do**

This role will wear many hats and will need to bring a flexible, growth-minded attitude and openness to helping build new systems and solutions.

Though there is no ‘normal’ day in a scale-up, this role will have two main functions:

1. supporting and developing Zeti’s US customer pipeline, leading market research, and representing Zeti at external events, and
2. leading on the operational aspects of onboarding US customers, which will entail working alongside the UK Tech/Ops teams and dealing directly with customers to ensure satisfaction in Zeti’s technology.

Furthermore, this role will involve organizing Zeti’s internal systems, developing strong customer relationships, building a firm understanding of Zeti’s technology deployment and streamlining client communications to create a smooth onboarding process capable of scaling. You’ll be thinking creatively, working across time zones, meeting interesting people and learning tons (and joining a growing team of truly good humans).

**What you’ll need to have**

* 2+ years of professional experience in business development, customer satisfaction and/or operations
* An ability to coordinate multiple work streams at once and keep organized
* Interest in delivering exceptional results on tempo and exceeding customer expectations

* Previous customer service/complaint resolution experience
* A positive attitude and a willingness to pitch in, grow, mess up, and try again
* Confidence dealing with customers directly through a range of channels e.g. telephone, email, face to face etc. Strong empathy and relationship management skills.
* A pragmatic approach - you know that progress is better than perfection
* Must be self-motivated and able to work both independently and as a team. This job will require regular communication with the UK (meaning a handful of earlier mornings)
* This role is remote in Los Angeles with a requirement to be present at the Santa Monica office at least 1-2 times a week.
* A personal desire to help to solve the climate crisis

**Helpful but not required**

* Interest and/or experience in any of the following areas: electric vehicles, telematics, fintech, automotive finance, data, start-ups
* Experience in coordinating project plans and working to deadlines
* Familiarity with the fleet, trucking, or as-a-service industries
* Previous experience of utility billing practices
* Competence in managing customer pipelines and lead generation
* Knowledge of using Google Drive (Docs, Gmail, Sheets, Slides), Notion and basic CRM software

**You should apply if you are**

* Interested in working with a diverse team to push boundaries in an incumbent industry
* Eager to learn and grow
* A proactive problem solver who looks at issues as opportunities to learn and exceed expectations
* Used to delivering exceptional results with limited supervision and resources
* Openminded and happy to wear many hats as needed
* Commercially aware and willing to find outcomes that make sense for business, customer, and planet.
* Willing to work flexible hours at least once a week to align with the working hours of our operations colleagues in London.

**Diversity and inclusion**

We have a high standard for the role of diversity in our team and hold this tightly in our core values. We strongly believe that diversity of thought improves the performance of a team, diversity of perspective improves the culture of a team, and diversity of background improves the creativity and solutions of a team.

In our view, the best way to create a successful community within Zeti is to build an environment void of code-switching – we want you to be the best version of yourself and provide you with the tools you need to get there.

We recognize that Zeti’s success only comes from a space where everyone’s voice is deeply valued and heard. Open communication, innovation and collaboration are the foundations on which we believe Zeti will grow and achieve its full potential.

We recognize that these voices are still currently under-represented in finance and tech.
