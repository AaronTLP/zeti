      heading: FAQs
    accordions:
      - heading: How is data protection managed and is Zeti Hub GDPR-compliant?
        rich_editor: >-
          Zeti processes and stores personal data about Zeti Hub users from
          customer organisations, and in this respect, it is subject to GDPR.
          Our Technology and Operations teams follow a robust policy to handle
          this data.


          It is worth noting that Zeti does not currently store or process personal data about the drivers or rental customers of fleet operators, who themselves are customer organisations. Therefore, GDPR does not apply in this respect.
      - heading: How much does Zeti Hub cost?
        rich_editor: At the moment, the cost of Zeti Hub is included in the origination
          and service fees payable by lenders on contracts facilitated by Zeti
          as an organisation.
      - heading: What software does and can Zeti Hub integrate with?
        rich_editor: Zeti Hub integrates with a number of different types of services in
          order to digitise and automate key automotive processes. These range
          from telematics suppliers (e.g. GeoTab) payment processing engines
          (e.g. Stripe), public vehicle maintenance databases (e.g. the UK
          government's Department for Transport's MOT API) and residual value
          databases (e.g. Black Book). We continue to add further integrations
          to improve the customer experience for our lenders and fleet
          operators.
      - heading: Who does Zeti use for payment processing?
        rich_editor: Zeti Hub primarly uses Stripe for payment processing, with
          additional integrations built to providers like GoCardless.
      - heading: How does Zeti track all of it's vehicles?
        rich_editor: When vehicles are deployed as part of a contract that Zeti is
          managing, either a hardware-based or software-only telematics solution
          is implemented. This is principally for billing purposes in per-mile
          contracts as it allows Zeti Hub to access vehicle odometer data to
          measure utilisation. However, we do process additional information
          from those telematics solutions in order to offer further services to
          our customers, such as live residual value modelling, dynamic emission
          saving reporting and battery health monitoring.
      - heading: Does the platform use AI?
        rich_editor: Yes. Zeti Hub currently uses so-called 'weak AI' by incorporating
          machine-led decision-making to automate the execution of contracts. As
          time progresses, Zeti Hub will leverage more and more 'strong' AI,
          enabling a more personalised customer experience using techniques like
          machine and deep learning.
