        Transport is becoming an on-demand service. Fleet operators need to
        adopt low or zero-emission vehicles; whether due to customer demand,
        legislative requirements, or simply because it’s the right thing to do. 


        However, financing is expensive and often disconnected from revenue generation, not to mention the hidden costs and penalties found with traditional leasing. 


        Zeti’s pay-per-mile financing optimises your cash flow and can help secure your profit margin.

      - heading: Pay-per-mile
        rich_editor: We offer true pay-per-mile vehicle fleet financing; pooled across
          the fleet, rather than per vehicle. There is no penalty for driving
          over your estimated monthly mileage. Our contracts are based on a
          contracted mileage commitment and allow for greater flexibility in
          payments than traditional finance.

      - heading: "Fully automated billing "
        rich_editor: Billing and Payment collection are entirely automated and always
          available on our dedicated Fleet Operator portal. for your ease of
          use, check any historic information whenever you like in your
          dedicated portal.

      - heading: Monitor your fleet in real-time
        rich_editor: Our digital platform integrates with best-in-class telematics to
          capture data from each vehicle in real-time, giving you insight into
          live fleet behavior through the Fleet Operator portal.
        image: /img/lexus.jpeg
      - heading: No hidden costs
        rich_editor: Unlike traditional fixed-duration finance with estimated mileage,
          having a fixed contracted mileage means the total cost of ownership is
          always accurate and transparent. You pay for what you’ve used.
        image: /img/lexus.jpeg
      - heading: Sustainability focused
        rich_editor: Our focus is to accelerate the adoption of zero emission vehicles.
          We appreciate that zero-emission technologies may not be applicable to
          all vehicle types and industries just yet. Therefore we also support
          ultra-low emission vehicles. We seek to boost adoption of clean
          vehicles but won’t dictate the underlying clean technology to be used.

            "A particular benefit of the ZERO platform is the pooling of vehicle
            mileage; with a contracted aggregate mileage across all vehicles, we
            don’t need to juggle individual cabs to a fixed mileage or end
            date."

    accordions:
      - heading: Who provides the finance for the vehicles?
        rich_editor: We work with any Institutional Fund (i.e. banks, insurance firms,
          pension funds, family offices) that is seeking to invest in clean
          assets. Zeti turns transportation into a new clean asset class and is
          therefore able to support a wide range of financiers as they seek to
          add zero-emission vehicles to their portfolios. These are most often
          financiers who previously invested in solar and wind projects.
      - heading: What kind of vehicles can you finance?
        rich_editor: Zeti supports the financing of commercial vehicles across any
          industry including, but not limited, to taxi, rideshare, delivery,
          logistics, transit and haulage.
      - heading: Can Zeti fund any vehicle?
        rich_editor: We will only support the funding of zero or ultra-low-emission
          vehicles.
      - heading: What is ZERO?
        rich_editor: The ZERO platform is the patent-pending automated asset financing
          platform that enables our pay-per-mile finance model. It handles all
          billing and payments, maps all assets, reports environmental benefits
          and provides online portals for both fleet operators and financiers.
          You will interact with ZERO through your Fleet Operator Portal.
      - heading: Does Zeti finance consumers?
        rich_editor: Zeti does not provide its pay-per-mile product directly to
          consumers, yet! Stay tuned.
      - heading: How is the mileage monitored?
        rich_editor: The mileage is monitored via best-in-class telematics. Think of
          this as a ‘smart meter’ for a vehicle, which allows us to seamlessly
          measure usage without having to ask for odometer readings.
      - heading: Where does Zeti operate?
        rich_editor: Zeti is active and supporting the deployment of clean vehicles in
          Europe and the USA with offices in London, Los Angeles and New York
          with plans to expand further in the future.
      - heading: Where can I find more in-depth information about Zeti's products and
          services?
        rich_editor: If you’re a fleet operator, manufacturer or financier interested in
          learning more about Zeti, please get in touch at hello@zeti.group.
