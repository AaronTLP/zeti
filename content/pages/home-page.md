              attractive pay-per-mile finance**


              Zeti helps you sell your zero-emission vehicles by allowing you to offer your fleet customers the option of paying per mile, rather than having a fixed monthly cost. Zeti can even deploy your in-house financing division’s money through its platform to turn it into a pay-per-mile offering.

            A particular benefit of the ZERO platform is the pooling of vehicle
            mileage; with a contracted aggregate mileage across all vehicles, we
            don’t need to juggle individual cabs to a fixed mileage or end date
