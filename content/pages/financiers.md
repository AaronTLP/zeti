        ESG investment in ‘real’ clean assets has been primarily restricted to a
        limited number of technologies including solar PV, wind, battery and
        biomass technologies. With the deployment of zero-emission vehicles
        globally, aggregating clean transport at scale provides a new, proven
        clean asset class for institutional investors with attractive
        risk-adjusted returns.


        It can be hard for traditional automotive lenders to stand out in a crowded market. Zeti can help such lenders differentiate their offering and have a strategic advantage in securing customers whilst generating attractive risk-adjusted returns and gaining operational insight.
