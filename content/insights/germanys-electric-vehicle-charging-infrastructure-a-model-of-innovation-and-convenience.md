Electric vehicles (EVs) have gained significant traction worldwide, and as governments and individuals alike push for a more sustainable future, charging infrastructure has become a vital part of this transition. In Germany, the EV charging infrastructure stands out as a model of innovation and convenience but this is far from the truth for the United States which still suffers from variable charging availability resulting in inconsistencies in the charging experience and inter-state travel being far less convenient.

Recently our very own Jon Stafford, Senior VP of North American Sales, took a trip to Germany and, keen to compare the EV experience to that at home, rented a Tesla Model Y and embarked on a 1,000-mile road trip around Southern Germany.

Jon's route around Germany

It’s no secret Germany is renowned for its precision engineering, and when it comes to EV charging infrastructure, it doesn't disappoint. In recent years, Germany has emerged as a pioneer in promoting sustainable mobility, and one of the standout features of its EV ecosystem is its comprehensive and user-friendly charging infrastructure. After all, it hosts some of the world's most renowned vehicle manufacturers including Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi, all of which have made substantial commitments to electrification. But what truly sets Germany apart is the emphasis on providing additional services to enhance the charging experience. Where previously one might sit in the diver’s seat, drinking lukewarm coffee from a vending machine waiting for a full charge, there’s now a whole host of amenities available including shopping, restaurants and even cinemas.

> If you are anything like me, you've probably never driven a vehicle outside the US and to be honest, I wasn’t sure what side of the street to drive on or if we were even allowed to drive?! Like my car at home in Maryland, I chose to rent a Tesla Model Y when I landed in Munich and I was planning to only utilize the Tesla supercharging network if possible. I must admit that the charging locations were super convenient and located in areas that gave me something to do for 20-30 minutes. It's hard to believe, but charging and range anxiety never even crossed my mind. After 2 weeks on the autobahn and nearly 1,000 miles on the odometer, I can confirm it was an awesome experience that I would definitely do again!

Germany's electric vehicle charging infrastructure sets a global standard for innovation and convenience. Its dense and well-distributed network of charging stations, integrated services, and government support for EV adoption have created an ecosystem that encourages people to make the switch to electric vehicles. While the United States is making progress in this area, Germany's experience offers valuable lessons on how to create a comprehensive and user-friendly EV charging infrastructure that promotes sustainable transportation on a large scale. Understanding and implementing these lessons in the US will be crucial in the shift to cleaner transport nationwide.
