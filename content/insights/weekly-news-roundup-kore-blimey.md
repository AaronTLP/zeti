  ### **Overview**

This EV will be built under the Citroen brand and the model will bear the e-C3 mark and will be marketed somewhere between the Dacia Spring and the Opel Astra. The company is able to offer a low price point by offering the EV in 3 trim levels, each with a maximum of five options. This tactic has been deployed by other OEMs, such as Ford, in order to streamline the production process and increase profit margins.

The current NEV tax exemption was pencilled to end on December 31st, 2023. However, China’s purchase tax exemption on NEVs will remain in place between January 1st 2024, to December 31st, 2027. Furthermore, between January 1st 2024 to December 31st 2025, the total exemption amount per unit will not exceed $4,179. The tax exemption, however, will be halved between January 1st 2026 to December 31st 2027. The market response has been positive, with industry consensus stating this should help increase (domestic) EV sales and have positive spill over effects on the raw battery materials market.

This is a significant decision, as it opens charging accessibility for (US) EV owners. This follows the news, earlier this month, that SK Signet opened its [manufacturing hub](https://d397wm04.eu1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DP+113/d397wm04/VX8CYL2tvSlRW25XJ4c5tD6Q6W87_Sgk504rnjMXl4q93lScZV1-WJV7CgZ30W14QwQY86HJqlW20ZTRw2l_rNSW860Q0p6K33xdW8S7d6l291LwlW8TPx0n8rrYsjW71t8MS2Q0gHxN1KxsBVvNVrtW2bRCbh9hl2xSN8BWdbbpZPcXW4D7M6v1DVz_XW5YcnwT2LYKk1W59lLYj76CN8lW5H26DK2LbR1nW61HySx80TQc9N7-0KS7bJBldW2f94dt9d0WCxW6j68wR8BL796W67K6DB19L4WGW7c5_Qf8dPdx6W4FJB8k4rPqfHW2_pth03qJ6JYW7L7Sg-5C0LHMW7VztRY53VdNTW17G0M110KYk8W8tZxtC3m3wLjW7Hb3lS8P-r17W3qKkB62bH37xW4yLF3H2ZcxMwW4C0XZ44-lM2CW5MdnK31bbznh3cfd1) in Plano, Texas, which is designed to produce more than 10,000 ultra-fast chargers annually.

This investment comes at a good time, as NIO missed Q1 23 earnings expectations due to the Price War, US Fed rate hikes and geopolitical risks. All these factors have contributed to NIO shares falling by 85% since 2021. The Price War materially impacted NIO, as in Q1 23, gross margins fell to 1.5% compared to 14.6% in Q1 22. This capital injection should help smooth its cash flows and guarantee (short-to-midterm) future product developments.

Horizon’s range of financing options should help accelerate the rollout of fleet electrification by financing both the above-ground charging infrastructure as well as any required energy system enhancements.

The factory had already secured private financing, with an initial $75m tranche from Siemens Financial Services and Quanta Services (a network infrastructure firm) however the $850m loan will help accelerate the buildout. This factory is pencilled in to start delivering batteries by Q4 2024/Q1 2025.

This is great news for Rivian drivers, as they can access the biggest USA charging network. Rivian has stated that by H1 2024, customers will be able to access 12,000 Tesla Superchargers with adapters in the USA and Canada. This further solidifies Tesla’s position as the industry standard leader in EV charging, as this follows recent news flow of adoption by other entities such as GM, Ford BTC Power and the state of Texas.

This, in part, stems from the VF 8 model, experiencing software bugs that resulted in the US National Highway Safety Administration issuing an alert stating a *software error may cause the multifunction head unit display to go blank*. This program will offer customers cash or a service voucher for any vehicle issues.

This new funding follows on from the £26m already invested in charging infrastructure across Wales since 2021. This has resulted in more than 1,600 charging points being made. This ramp-up in funding is, in part, due to the Government trying to hit its target of providing charging points for every 20 miles of the strategic trunk network across Wales by 2025.
